# Neuroradiology The Essentials
## Acquired Metabolic, Systemic, Toxic Disorders

### Acute Hypertensive Encephalopathy (PRES)
* Also known as PRES, is caused by acute severe hypertension.
* Predeliction for parietoocciptal regions (Posterior Circulation) with vasogenic oedema (high FLAIR, following non-vascular distribution). BG may be involved.
* Diffusion is not restricted. 

### Wernicke Encephalopathy
* Caused by thiamine deficiency, seen in severe malnutrition, alcohol abuse.
* FLAIR shows bilateral hyperintensity in: **mamillary bodies**, around 3rd ventricle, medial thalami, tectal plate and periaqueductal area.

### Hepatic Encephalopathy
* Cause by acute/chronic liver failure.
* High T1 signal in globus pallidus bilaterally.
* Thought to reflect manganese deposition (more metal).

### CO Poisoning
* Carbon monoxide impairs oxygen transport.
* The hallmark is bilateral injury to globus pallidus.
* Initially vasogenic oedema will present with mild enlargement of GP. With time this is replaced by gliosis and cystic encephalomalacia (atrophy).
* *Eye-of-the-tiger* presentation on T2/FLAIR.

### Osmotic Demyelination
* Caused by rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia. 
* Central pontine myelinolysis.
* Abnormal symmetric central pons high T2 signal, whilst sparing the periphery. Restricted diffusion seen early in process.
* Leads to coma.

### Mesial Temporal Sclerosis
* Unknown etiology, maybe due to several different insults.
* Bilateral atrophy of hippocampus (20%).
* Common cause of complex partial seizures.

# Pediatric CHEST
## Pediatric Imaging: The Requisites

### Chest Imaging
* Stridor when **expiratory** -> pathology below thoracic inlet. When **inspiratory** neck + lung x-ray.

#### Development of Airway / Lungs
* Laryngotracheal tube: 4th week gestation, completed at 28 weeks.
* Alveoli increase. Type II pneumocytes produce surfactant (wk 23-24) best at 36 weeks.
* The development of cartilage lags behind branching of airways. Hence there may be bronhcopulmonary foregut malformations:
	- Congenital lobar emphysema
	- Bronchial atresia
	- Sequestration

### Infection / Inflammation

#### Bronchoiolitis
* Diffuse peripheral airway inflammation. Tidal volume is small, air trapping occurs.
* On x-ray there is hyperinflation, cuffing (lateral view), flattening of diaphrams.

#### TTN (Transient Tachypnea of Newborn)
* Wet lung disease. Due to delayed clearance of lung-fluid. Often in C-Sec.
* X-ray shows pulmonary edema (takes 2-3 days to resolve).

#### Neonatal Pneumonia
* Patchy, perihilar and hyperinflation. There is pleural effusion.
* GBS looks like RDS with bilateral granular opacities but also has pleural fluid.

#### RDS (Surfactant Disease)
* Alveoli collapse giving low lung volume.
* Bilateral granular opacities (some alveoli are open, some are closed)
* Prominent air bronchograms since the larger airways stay open.
* Peak at 6 hours.
* NO pleural effusions, ddx to GBS.

### Mediastinum
* Thymus may be prominent. Doesn't displace trachea / vessels.
* Thymic wave sign
* Thymic sail sign (abuts the minor fissure of the RLL).

### Trachea
* There is mild shouldering then normal diameter as it goes down. Slight left shift, due to right Ao.
* If central or to the right, suspect a mass.
* In < 5yo trachea is flexible and can buckle.

### Lines and Tubes in Neonates
* **UAC**: w.r.t. SMA level => high [T6-T9], low [L3-L5].
* **UVC**: Through umbilical vein into the LPV, then through ductus venosus and into the liver vein (mid / left) and into IVC. 
* Should be at diaphragm level. Straight up, to the right of midline.
* **PICC**: Shouldn't be too deep.
* **ETT**: 1 cm above carina. If there is air-bubble around it, then the tube might be in oesphagus. Look for gas-filled bowels, low lung volumes.
* **ECMO**: VA right CCA or femoral artery, vein cath is in IJV. Tip is opaque small dot (in RA). VV is a single 2x lumen cath in IJV (to RA).

### Congenital
#### Broncial Atresia
* TODO
#### Bronchogenic Cyst
#### CLH (Congenital Lobar Hyperinflation)
#### CPAM
#### Sequestration

# Neuroradiology The Essentials
## Hemorrhage

### Parenchymal Hemorrhage
* Specific but varied appearance on MR, dependent on time.
* In young adults, vascular malformations are most common cause of spontaneous bleeding.
* In adults, it is hypertension. Always look for mets.
* Oedmea surrounds the hematoma!
* Typical locations are: **BG (putamen)**, thalamus, pons and cerebellar hemisphere.
* **Oxyhemoglobin** (hyperacute) -> **deoxyhemoglobin** (acute) -> **intracellular methemoglobin** (early subacute) -> **extracellular methemoglobin** (late subacute) -> **hemosiderin** (chronic).
* **Oxyhemoglobin** is hyperacute, has SI of fluid (T2 high, T1 low).
* **Deoxyhemoglobin** is distinctively low on T2, T1 iso to hypo.
* **Methemoglobin** (subacute) has high SI on T1 and can be divided into intra- vs extracellular. In intra, blood will be high on T1 and low on T2 (due to susceptibility). With RBC lysis, methemoglobin becomes extracellular where it is distinctively T1-T2 high.
* **Hemosiderin**: met-hb is converted to hemosiderin + ferritin. This is low on T2 (susceptibility). There may be unresorbed blood in a cavity with hemosiderin ring. Otherwise if resorbed, a hemosiderin cleft forms. This contrast-enhances.

### Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
* CT can be negative if too long time (week) or too little blood.
* MRI is more sensitive but difficult to interpret.
* FLAIR is extremly sensitive to changes in CSF, high signal is thus seen in sulci. DDx is meningitis, 100% o2 ventilation. 
* On T2*-WI (GRE) acute is low SI in distinction to normal high CSF. In combination with FLAIR, this finding is specific for acute SAH.
* Depending on time (3-days), T1 high due to met-hb. This is high for weeks!

### Superficial Siderosis
* Hemosiderin deposition in macrophages within memebranes lining the CSF spaces.
* The cause is recurrent SAH due to: hemorrhagic neoplasm, ruptured aneurysm or vascular malformation.
* Cerebellum most common site.
* Sensorineural hearing loss, pyramidal tract signs, ataxia, II,V,VII,VIII symptoms.

## Herniation
* Subfalcine is most common herniation, due to brain mass on one side. The ACA can herniate and cause infarction.
* Descending transtentorial herniation is second most common. Uncus of MTL, hippocampus.
* Tonsillar herniation at foramen magnum.

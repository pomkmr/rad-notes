# Pediatric MSK
## Fundamentals of Pediatric Imaging
* **Epiphysis**: refers to bone part that articulates to adjacent bone. It is perpendicular to long axis of bone.
* **Apophysis**: doesn't have an articulating surface. Site of tendon insertion. Parallel to long axis.
	* Common Apophysis: tibial tuberosity, ischial tuberosity, calcaneus, pelvic synchondroses.
	* Common Epiphysis: distal femoral / knee. Capitellum.
	
* Distal Femoral Metaphyseal Irregularity
	- Irregular cortical margination of posteromedial femur, site of adductor magnus insertion. Bilateral.
*  Risser Staging System: on iliac crest.
	
### Trauma
* Children's bones have more water content and are thus more bendy. They deform rather than break. They heal faster, periosteal reaction can be seen in less than 2 weeks.
* Plastic bowing deformity: Bowing, no fracture line seen initially but follow-up show scelerosis [radius, ulna, fibula are common locations].
* Buckle fracture: Especially in fingers, one side of cortex is bent.
* Greenstick fracture.

* Involvement of physis, if fx through articular surface = 3+:
	- 1. Only in physis. Tend to be < 5 yo.(SCFE)
	- 2. Don't involve the epiphysis (MCC).
	- 3. Don't involve metaphysis.
	- 4. All involved.
	- 5. Compression.
	
### Common Fractures in Children
#### Wrist
* Most common fx site. Always check for extension into physis (30%).
* Look at the pronator fat pad.

#### Elbow
* Most common is a supracondylar fracture (as opp to radial head in adults).
* 25% are incomplete and hard to see on x-ray.
* Anterior Humeral Line (AHL) should bisect the middle third of the capitellum.
* Radiocapitellar line should bisect the capitellum on all views. Otherwise suspect a Monteggia fracture and xray the whole arm.
* Check hourglass figure (figure of 8 on side view)
* CRITOE.
* Distal Humerus Physeal Separation: TODO.
* 
#### Ankle
* Triplane fx: Type IV in adolescents.
* Tillaux fx: Type III. Occurs because medial tibial physis closes before lateral. Widening of medial physis line.
* In toddlers, spiral fx of tibia, stress calcaneal and cuboid fractures are common.

#### Avulsion Fractures

##### Hip
* Iliac Crest: transverse abdominis, int oblique, ext oblique.
* ASIS: Sartorius
* AIIS: Rectus femoris
* Ischial Apophysis: hamstrings [biceps femoris, gracilis, semimembranosus and semitendinosus].
* Lesser Trochanter: iliopsoas.

##### Knee
* Anterior medial Tibial spine: ACL
* Lateral Tibial Spine: LCL, Segond
* Fibular head: Biceps, arcuate ligament attaches on tip of fibula.
* Patellar sleeve (inferior patella pole): prox patellar tendon
* Tibial tubercle: distal patellar tendon

### Hip Disorders
#### DDH
* Abnormal development of acetabulum leading to increased laxity.
* Ultrasound after 2 weeks.
* X-ray after 3 months.
* Hilgenreiner Line | Perkin Line
* Shelton's arc.
* Femoral head should be in inner lower quadrant fromed from lines.
* Alpha angle is decreased in DDH.
 
#### Perthes
* Idiopathic AVN of femoral epiphysis.
* X-ray is initially normal.
* Then it shows subchondral linear lucency (crescent sign) on frog-view.
* Meyer's dysplasia is a ddx, appears at 2-3 yo. Fragmented and not completed ossified femoral head.

#### SCFE
* Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphsys, occurs in growing teens.
* Idiopathic SH1 fx.

### Scoliosis
* Often S-shaped, dextrocurvature at thorax, often idiopathic.
* NMD is a ddx which produces a C-shaped scoliosis.
* Cobb's angle: < 10 normal, < 20 external brace, > 40 surgery

# Pediatric Liver And GB
## Pediatric Imaging: The Requisites
### Neonatal Jaundice
* 5% of neonates have physiological jaundice as RBC are broken down in the polycythemic newborn!
* If persistent after 2 weeks, 90% will have: [biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, choledochal cyst].

#### Biliary Atresia
* Identify these before 2 months of age for Kasai procedure (TODO).
* Absence of gallbladder is suggestive of BA.
* Presence of GB excludes BA, think NeoHep instead.
* If you see an echogenic structure in porta hepatis, this is remnant of CBD in BA.
* Hepatobiliary scint Tc99m is most reliable way of ddx.
#### Choledochal Cyst
* Local dilation of bile duct system.
* TODO: check classification.

### Liver Masses
* A lot of ddx, just check this table.

| Age | DDx |
| --- | --- |
| < 5 yo | Hepatoblastoma (+AFP) |
| | Hepatic Hemangioma |
| | Mesenchymal Hamartoma |
| | Metastasis (Wilms) |
| > 5 yo | HCC (+AFP) |
| | Adenoma|
| | Hemagioma |
| | Metastasis |

* TODO: Fill this section

#### Hepatoblastoma
* MC primary malignancy of liver in childhood.
* Often painless mass.
* Large heterogenous mass on US.
* On x-ray, 50% have calcifications.
#### Liver Hemangioma
* Congenital: present at birth and involute by 1 year. These are solitary lesions!
* Infantile: Grow during first few years and involute by 7 years. Well-defined hypo masses. Peripheral nodular CE.
#### Mesenchymal Hamartoma
* Benign masses before 2yo.
* Multiseptated, cystic masses with no Doppler.

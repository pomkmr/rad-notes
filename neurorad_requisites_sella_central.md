# Neuroradiology: The Requisites
## Sella and Central Skull Base
### Anatomy
* The sphenoid bone has the shape of a bat with wings and feet! The feet are the medial and lateral pterygoid processes, the head is the body of sphenoid and the wings are the greater and lesser wings.
* Planum sphenoidale is the anterior part of the bone.
* The pterygopalatine fossa is an important conduit for spread of tumor and infection in skull base. Anteriorly it communicates with orbital apex (via inferior orbital fissure / sphenopalatine fossa). Laterally to the masticator space (via pterygomaxillary fissure). Superoposteriorly with the foramen rotundum and inferoposteriorly with the vidian canal (foramen lacerum).
* Important foramina of skull base:
	* **Hypoglossal Canal**: Nerve and artery (primitive connection between cervical ICA and proximal basilar artery). Meningeal branch of asc pharyngeal artery and a small emisary vein (anterior condyloid vein). TODO: Lesions of the hypoglossal canal.
	* **Jugular Foramen**: Between temporal bone and occipital bone. Two parts where the *pars nervosa* is anteromedial and *pars vascularis* is posterolateral separated by a fibrous septum (jugular spur). The pars vascularis contains X and XI in a common sheath medial to the jugular bulb. Pars nervosa contains IX and inferior petrosal sinus.
	* **Internal Auditory Canal**: Superior to the jugular foramen, contains VII and VIII.
	* **Dorello's canal** is located just below petrous apex and contains VI on its way to cavernous sinus. The canal is located in the inferior petrosal sinus and the nerve can be seen running through it! Abducens runs lateral to the ICA in the CS. Enters the orbit via SOF and terminates in lateral rectus. The dorsal meningeal artery may also run through the canal. Abducens palsy may be thus caused by BS injury, inflammation (Gardenigo syndrome VI + V affected) and increased venous pressure.
	* **Superior Orbital Fissure** (SOF): III, IV, V1, VI, orbital MMA branch, recurrent mengineal artery and superior ophathlmic vein.
	* **Inferior Orbital Fissure**: infraorbital artery, vein, nerve (V2).
	* **Optic Canal**: Optic nerve. Opthalamic artery.
	* **Foramen Rotundum**: V2, artery + emissary veins.
	* **Foramen Ovale**: V3, lesser petrosal nerve, vasculature.
	* **Foramen Spinosum**: MMA + MMV, recurrent branch of V3.
	* **Foramen Lacerum**: Meningeal branch of asc. pharyngeal artery + nerve.
	

### Cavernous Sinus
TODO

### The Pituitary Gland
* The anterior lobe is divided into:
	* Pars tuberalis: thin anterior tissue along anterior infundibulum. Rare for tumors to originate here.
	* Pars intermedia: between distalis and posterior lobe. May contain small cysts (colloid cysts) amd may be the origin of Rathke cleft cysts.
	* Pars distalis: large intrasellar portion.	

* The posterior lobe has a direct blood supply via inferior hypophyseal artery. The inferior hypophyseal arteries arise form supraclinoid ICA and supply a plexus around base of stalk, later to anterior lobe. This is seen as delayed contrast uptake, the anterior lobe is also more susceptible to ischaemia.
* Infundibulum is an important landmark. Marks the anterior portion of the posterior pituitary. The posterior portion develops from neuroectoderm from base of brain. Anterior lobe and pars intermedia/tuberalis are from Rathke's pouch.

### Imaging of The Pituitary Gland
* Anterior lobe is *iso* to brain on T1 and T2.
* Posterior lobe is *high* on T1 and low on T2.

Next we discuss intrasellar lesions!

### Pituitary Adenoma
* Microadenomas are < 1cm and are hypo on T1, variable on T2. 75% are hormonally active.
* Dynamic MR is good for detection of microadenomas since they do not initially enhance.
* To check for sinus infiltration, if it grows beyond the lateral edge of the sinus carotid artery, there is infiltration.
* Macroadenoma (> 1cm) have propensity for hemorrhage and infarction because of bad blood supply. Bromocriptine increases risk (Dopamine receptor agonist).

### Metastatic Disease
* Up to 12%, most common is breast followed by GI carcinoma.

### TODO
* Abscess
* Granulomatous Disease
* Lymphocytic Hypophysitis
* Posterior Pituitary Tumors: Choriostoma
* Intrasellar Meningioma: Look for dural tail, carotid artery narrowing.

### Empty Sella Syndrome
* May be seen in aging and in women with IIH (hypertension). Other findings include enlarged optic nerve sheath and papilledema. There may be increased fat.

Now we discuss suprasellar lesions.

### Infundibular Lesions
* Infundibulum shouldn't be larger than basilar artery at level of clivus. Granulomatous diseases can enlarge it. Glioma is ddx.
* Diabetes Insipudus is common.

### Rathke Cleft Cyst
* Anterior sellar (25%), suprasellar (5%) or both (70%).
* The difference between this and craniopharygioma is the cell type. In RCC the lesions are lined with cuboidal / columnar epithelium, in craniopharygioma they are squamous cells.
* Variable intensity on T1 and T2.
* RCC do not calcify, but cranioph do. RCC enhance less and have no nodular enhancement (usually rim-like).

### Arachnoid Cyst
* About 15% of all arachnoid cysts are suprasellar.
* Don't enhance.
* May infiltrate the third ventricle.
* Epidermoid is ddx.

Next we discuss midline developmental lesions.

### Lipoma, Teratoma, Dermoid
* See other notes.

### Epidermoid
* TODO.

### Craniopharyngioma
* Arise from Rathke's pouch.
* Large, heterogenous tumors at skull base.
* Calcification (rimlike), cyst formation, solid / nodular enhancement.

### Meningioma
* Enhance homogenously.
* Narrow the carotid artery.
* Location is important to verify.

### Glioma
* TODO.

### Hamartoma of Tuber Cinereum
* TODO.
* Located anterior to the mamillary bodies.

### Aneurysm
* TODO.

## Pediatric Imaging: The Requisites

### NEC
* Idiopathic ischaemia and infection of intestines.
* Premature infants mostly.
* X-ray shows focally dilated bowel with thickening.
* Abnormal gas pattern that remains unchanged.
* Pneumatosis, air in biliary tree!
* Look for free air:
	- Generally lucent abdomen.
	- Falciforme sign.
	- Rigler sign (bowel walls).
	- If gasless abdomen after multiple images = perforation.
* Ultrasound
	- Initially bowel is thickened at 2-3 mm wall. When ischaemia sets in, the wall thins. Same thing happens with Doppler which first increases then decreases.
	- Pneumatosis (reverbration artefact, echogenic areas close to probe).
	- Free gas in abdomen / portal system: echogenic sparkles that travel.

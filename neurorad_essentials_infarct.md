# Neuroradiology The Essentials
## Infarction

* In young patients, causes are congenital, heart disease, sickle cell disease.
* In elderly there is atherosclerotic involvement.
* Left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's), left posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke), in left-dominant patients.

### Arterial Territory Infarcts
* The **MCA** supplies lateral hemispheres, lenticulostriate to GP/Putamen/anterior IC limb.
* The **PCA** supplies posteroinferior temporal lobe, medial parietal, occipital and brainstem, thalamus, IC.
* The **ACA** supplies anterior putamen, caudate, hypothalamus, CC, medial hemispheres.
* Restricted diffusion (high DWI / low ADC) = cytotoxic oedema.
* The territory of PICA and AICA is complementary. PICA is most common.

### Lacunar Infarcts
* Seen in hypertension.
* BG, IC, Thalamus, Brainstem.
* Infarcts in pons are sharply demarcated to one median. Lateral pontine infarcts are uncommon. The ddx for unilateral pontine lesion is: MS. For bilateral lesions it is pontine myelinolysis and pontine glioma.

### Medullary Infarcts
* In medulla, both lateral and medial infarcts are seen.
* Lateral medullary infarcts (Wallenberg): dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, ipsi Horner and contralateral loss of pain/temperature. Known complication of chiropractic neck manipulation. The blood supply is from vertebral artery / PICA.
* Medial medullary infarcts cause limb weakness on contralateral side, hypoglossal weakness on ipsi (deviation towards infarct). The blood supply is from anterior splinal artery.

### Temporal Evolution
* DWI is very sensitive to infarcts, within minutes cytotoxic oedema develops in ischemia. (Hyperacute < 6 hours).
* In cytotoxic edema there is impaired function of NaK pump leading to net flow of water into cell. This leads to slight swelling.
* Vasogenic edema develops at 24 hours, representing overall increase in tissue water content. It has high T2 with low T1 signal. Vasogenic edema is seen on CT as area of low attenuation. Can presist for weeks.
* In one week, ADC returns to normal, but DWI can be high still (due to T2 shine through).
* **Hyperacute** < 6 hours
* **Acute** < 24 hours to 1 week
* **Subacute** 1 to 2 months (early subacute is 1 week, late subacute; BBB disruption)
* **Chronic** > 2 months

### Abnormal Contrast Enhancement
* Enhancment can be seen in first day. A short enhancing vessel can be seen.
* Parenchymal enhancement is gyriform and seen in territorial infarcts seen > 1 week after to 1 month.

### CT In Infarction
* Hyperdense MCA, loss of insular ribbon, BG definition loss.
* CT perfusion, look at CBV for infarct, MTT / CBF for penumbra (at risk regions).

### Chronic Infarcts
* Focal atrophy with sulci widening and ex vacuo ventricular dilatation. Cystic encephalomalacia and gliosis are common.
* Wallerian degeneration high FLAIR signal distal to infarct site. Often seen in CS tract with large infarct of motor cortex.

# Pediatric GENITOURINARY
## Pediatric Imaging: The Requisites

### Normal
#### Kidneys
* Infants have very **hypoechoic** pyramids!
* In premature to some months, kidneys may be hyperechoic to spleen / liver.
* Decreased CM diff is a sign of disease.
* Always check size of kidney.
#### Ureters
* Try to image the whole ureter, esp. proximally and distally.
#### Urethra
* TODO

### Infections
#### Pyelonephritis
* Kidney is enlarged
* Loss of CM differentiation, there may be focal region.
* **Complications**: Abscess, hypo area with high Doppler rim. Can become perirenal.

### Renal Masses
* Always consider infection if a mass is seen.
| Group | Common Tumors |
| --- | --- |
| **Neonate** | Solid (Mesoblastic Nephroma) |
| | Cystic (Dysplastic kidney) |
| | Rare (Medullary carcinoma, Rhabdoid tumor, CC sarcoma, Angiomyolipo.)|
| **Toddler** | Wilms tumor. Cystic Nephroma |

#### Unilateral Masses
##### Mesoblastic Nephroma
* MC tumor in neonates. Heterogenous mass.
##### Wilms Tumor
* MC renal malignancy. 3-4 yo is mean age.
* US every 3 months till age 7.
* Large mass on ultrasound.
##### Angiomyolipoma
* Benign mass of smooth muscle cells, vessels and fat.
* Echogenic with internal vascularity.
* Intralesional fat.
* **Complications** are bleeding and aneurysm formation.
* Assc. with tuberous sclerosis.

#### Bilateral Masses
##### Nephroblastoma
* Presence of nephrogenic cells > 36 weeks.
* Homogenous and markedly enlarged kidneys.
* Nephrogenic rests are hypo to iso to normal kidney.
##### Lymphoma
* Rare due to lack of lymphoid tissue in kidney. Usually due to spread from retroperitoneum.
##### Leukemia
* Diffuse infiltration with marked enlargement.

#### Renal Cysts
##### ARPKD
* MC ciliopathy
* Massively enlarged kidneys due to dilated tubules / tiny cysts.
* Assc. portal htn.

##### ADPKD
* PKD1-gene (Chrm 16), PKD2 (Chrm 4) mutation.
* Larger cysts, in other organs too. As cysts grow they replace normal parenchyma leading to ESRF.

### Vascular Abnormalities
#### Renal Artery Stenosis
* Can cause HTN.
* Assc. with FMD, NF, Kawasaki, Takayasu.
* Focal area of narrowing giving turbulent flow.
* In parenchyma there is parvus tardus (damped upstroke)
* RA-Ao PSV > 3.5.

#### Renal Vein Stenosis
* Uncommon
* Leads to high RI in parenchyma. Less / No diastolic flow.

### Abnormalities of Ureters
* Grading 1 - 5 of VUR
* Hydronephrosis but normal distal ureter, think UPJO.
* Uretrocele is a dialtion of distal ureter, look carefully on ultrasound when checking bladder.

### Abnormalities of Calcium
* Leads to nephrocalcinosis: >90% is in pyramids.
* Kidney stones: give shadow and twinkle on Doppler.

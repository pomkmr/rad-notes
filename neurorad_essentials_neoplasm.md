# Neuroradiology The Essentials
## Neoplasms

### Pilocytic Astrocytoma
* Benign, WHO Grade I tumor.
* Occurs in cerebellum, optic pathway, thalamus, pons.
* Most common posterior fossa tumor (PFT) in childhood (close to medulloblastoma).
* Classically, a cystic PFT with enhancing mural nodule, mass effect on 4th ventricle. Thus causing hydrocephalus.
* The cystic component will be hyperintense on FLAIR (due to protein).
* If there is a lesion of the optic pathway, think NF1.
* In pons, it doesn't expand outside it.
* Tectal glioma: periaqueductal location, lack of contrast enhancement and long-term stability. Small bullous mass lesion, T2-hyper. Can cause obstructive hydrocephalus, ddx is benign aqueductal stenosis.

### Low-grade Astrocytoma
* WHO Grade II tumor. Infiltrative, well differentiated and slow growing.
* Focal mass lesion with epicenter in white matter.
* Homogenous, non-enhancing lesions with little mass effect and oedema.
* Most commonly in frontal / temporal lobe. Characteristically in insula.
* Isodense to brain on CT, so difficult to visualise.
* About half of pontine gliomas are low-grade (ddx pilocytic as above).

### Anaplastic Astrocytoma
* WHO Grade III, between low-grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma.
* Less well-defined, mildly hetrogenous with some contrast enhancement. There is moderate edema.
* ADC decreases with decrase in cell density (radiation necrosis).

### Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
* WHO Grade IV, highly malignant and rapidly growing. Shorter symptom time.
* Most common of all the astrocytomas, and the most common primary intracranial tumor.
* Hallmark of GBM is necrosis. Grows along white matter tracts and therefore can cross corpus callosum.
* Large lesion with thick irregular enhancing ring, gross central necrosis, mass effect and extensive oedema. CC tracts are very compact, thus high T2 signal across these represents tumor growth and not oedema.
* NAA is a marker for neuronal integrity (decrease in malignancy), Choline is a marker for increased cell turnover (increases in malignancy). Lactate results from anaerobic metabolism, in necrosis / ischaemia.

### Gliomatosis Cerebri
* By definition, diffusly infiltrating glial tumor involving at least 3 lobes. Enlarges the brain with T2-hyper signal.

### Oligodendroglioma (ODG)
* WHO Grade II. Well-differentiated, cortical / subcortical tumor.
* Calcification is common as is moderate enhancement.
* Due to slow growth and location, they cause calvarial erosion / remodelling.
* Fifty percent of oligodendrogliomas are mixed lesions (oligoastrocytoma).
* Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (Grade III) do occur. Higher grade gliomas show higher CBV (but meningioma have high CBV).

### Ganglioglioma
* WHO Grade I. Well-demarcated, slow growing tumor in the temporal lobe.
* Can be solid or cystic with a mural nodule. 50% have calcifications (like ODG).

### Hemangioblastoma
* Most common primary cerebellar tumor in adult.
* VHL disease predisposes for these.
* Well-defined cystic mass with enhancing mural nodule.

### Primary CNS Lymphoma
* Lymphoma carries a poor prognosis, always have this as a differential.
* Enhancing mass lesion in periventricular white matter / basal ganglia, often involving CC.
* Hyperdense on CT, restricted DWI on MRI (due to high cellularity). On T2, it is slighlty hypointense to brain.

### Medulloblastoma
* WHO Grade IV. Also known as a PNET (primitive neuroectodermal tumor).
* 2nd most common tumor of childhood (after pilocytic astrocytoma).
* Arise from the roof of the 4th ventricle (superior meduallry velum).
* DDx are pilocytic astrocytoma, ependymoma, choroid plexus papilloma, atypical teratoid tumor.

### Supratentorial PNET
* WHO Grade IV. Restricted diffusion.
* Most common presentation is a young child with large, complex hemispheric mass and little associated vasogenic oedema.

### Choroid Plexus Papilloma
* WHO Grade I. Highly vascular occuring the ventricles. DDx is CP carcinoma!

### Ependymoma
* Two-thirds of these are in the 4th ventricle, one-third are in supratentorial location (lateral ventricles). Calcifications are common.
* Tumor of young children.
* Can creep through / extend into the forman Luschka.

### Pituitary Microadenoma
* Prolactinomas are the most common lesion, 90% in women.
* Dopamine agonists (bromocriptine) are treatment of choice.
* Less common are GH / ACTH tumors.
* Rathke cleft cysts are the ddx, found in posterior pituitary.

### Pituitary Macroadenoma
* More than 1 centimeter.
* Macroadenomas are usually non-secretory, the symptoms come from size. Bilateral hemianopsia (compression of optic chiasm).
* On MRI, these are isointense to brain on T1 and T2. Moderate, uniform contrast enhancment.
* Care needs to be taken, determine if there is invasion into cavernous sinus.
* Suprasellar expansion is preceded by sellar expansion!
* DDx is intrasellar meningioma and metastasis.
* Pituitary apoplexy is bleed from pituitary. Treatment with bromocriptine can cause this.

### Craniopharygioma
* TODO

### Brain Metastases
* Lung, breast and renal cell cancers are most common to metastasize to brain.
* Frequently to gray-white matter junction, there may or may not be associated oedema.
* Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma) and breast, lung, melanoma.

### Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)
